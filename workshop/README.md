# Digital Developer Conference 2021 - Jumpstart your Journey to AI and Data Science

Welcome to the course! In this course we'll be using Jupyter notebooks to learn about Python3, use Python and the Pandas library to do some data visualisation, and learn about Python and data science. We use IBM Cloud Pak for Data to run the notebooks and build a Machine Learning model with the scikit learn framework, and we'll demonstrate AutoAI to build ML pipelines, deploy a model and save a notebook based on the exeperiment, and show some basic tests.

## Compatability

This workshop has been tested on [IBM Watson Studio and Cloud Pak for Data as a Service](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com)

The notebooks use `Python 3.7.10`.
